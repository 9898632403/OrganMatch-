#  OrganMatch+ – A Blockchain-Based Secure Organ Donation Platform

> **OrganMatch+** is a blockchain-powered decentralized application (DApp) that ensures transparency, trust, and security in the organ donation and transplantation process.  
> It leverages smart contracts and decentralized ledgers to automate donor-recipient matching, eliminate data tampering, and promote ethical organ donation practices.

---

##  Overview

OrganMatch+ aims to solve the challenges of traditional organ donation systems — such as data manipulation, lack of transparency, and unauthorized access — by using blockchain technology.  
Every donor and recipient record is securely stored in a **tamper-proof ledger**, verified through **smart contracts**, and managed in a **transparent decentralized network**.

---

##  Aim

To develop a **secure, transparent, and decentralized organ donation system** using blockchain technology, ensuring ethical and reliable management of donor and recipient data.

---

## ⚙️ Objectives

- Ensure authenticity and transparency of donor and recipient data  
-  Prevent data manipulation and unauthorized access  
-  Automate donor-recipient matching using smart contracts  
- Provide a decentralized platform for hospitals and authorities  
- Promote ethical and fraud-free organ donation practices

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|  **Blockchain Ledger** | Stores all donor-recipient records immutably |
| **Smart Contracts** | Automates organ matching, approval, and verification |
|  **Data Security** | Cryptographic security for all transactions |
|  **Decentralized Access** | Only verified hospitals & admins can update records |
| **Transparency** | Real-time traceability of organ donations |

---

##  System Architecture

**Architecture Flow:**

1. Donor and Recipient register through the DApp.  
2. Hospital/Admin verifies identity and health details.  
3. Smart contract executes matching and approval logic.  
4. Blockchain stores and secures verified transactions.  
5. Donor–Recipient linkage and updates are recorded immutably.

##  Setup & Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to run the **OrganMatch+** project on your local machine.

---

###   Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) → [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Python 3.x**
- **Metamask** browser extension
- **Hardhat** (automatically installed during setup)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

---

###   Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/9898632403/OrganMatch.git
cd OrganMatch

cd blockchain
npm install                # Install blockchain dependencies
npx hardhat compile        # Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat node           # Start a local blockchain network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost   # Deploy the contract

```
###   Setup Blockchain (Hardhat)

This folder contains the smart contracts for the project.

 ```bash
cd blockchain
npm install                # Install blockchain dependencies
npx hardhat compile        # Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat node           # Start a local blockchain network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost   # Deploy the contract
```

###   Setup Backend (Flask API)
This handles server-side logic and connects the DApp to blockchain data.

```bash
cd ../organ-donation-dapp/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install Python dependencies
python run.py                     # Start Flask backend
```

###   Setup Frontend (React + Vite)
This is your DApp interface for users (donors, recipients, hospitals).

```bash
cd ../
npm install           # Install frontend dependencies
npm run dev           # Start the React app
```

###   Connect Metamask to Local Network
Open Metamask → Networks → “Add Network”

Use the following details:

Network Name: Hardhat Localhost

RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/

Chain ID: 31337

Import one of the private keys shown in your Hardhat console.

Refresh your DApp page — Metamask should now connect automatically.

###   Run the DApp
Once everything is running:

Hardhat (Blockchain) → running

Flask (Backend) → running

React (Frontend) → running

Now open your browser and go to →
 http://localhost:5173/

You should see your OrganMatch dashboard live!
